The wars between the Persians and the Greeks, including the battle of Thermopylae, were recorded by a Greek historian called Herodotus, in his book, 'The Histories'. He was writing during the mid- fifth century BC,  only a few decades after the Persian wars took place, and so was able to listen to accounts of the war from those involved. He is known as the 'father of history'.</p>
