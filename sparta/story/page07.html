Dieneces looked at his grandfather, who had fallen silent. His grandfather appeared to organise his thoughts before continuing. "Sparta had <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/suppress.html','glos')">suppressed</a> the Helots, but we could not afford to forget that they forever threatened our way of life. We had always to be ready to fight; after all, there have always been many more Helots than Spartans. Our boys were educated in a way that emphasised their physical fitness, courage and obedience. Our girls' upbringing ensured that they were healthy and strong and so would have strong babies. There was no longer a place in our lives for luxury objects, nor for the craftsmen who made them".
