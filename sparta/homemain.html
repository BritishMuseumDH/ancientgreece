      ancient Greece, but during the classical period, it was a very different
      place to Athens.
      <p> Sparta was ruled by two kings and a Council of Elders. There was an
        assembly of citizens, but this did not have the power of the citizen
        assembly in democratic Athens.</p></td>

    <td>During the 5th century BC Sparta was very powerful. This was due to her
      army, which was feared by other Greeks. Sparta focused on producing good
      soldiers and all Spartan male citizens were part of the army. The Spartan
      army played an important role in the Greek victory over the Persians, in
      480-479 BC. </td>

<p>However, archaeological evidence shows us that Sparta was not always such a military-minded city. In earlier times, Spartan bronze and ivory workers produced beautiful objects and poetry flourished. Objects from this period provide evidence of this highpoint in Spartan culture.
