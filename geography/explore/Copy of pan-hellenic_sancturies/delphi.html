Delphi
</h3>

Delphi was the site of the oracle of Apollo. It was the most important oracle in the Greek world. A priestess called the pythia communicated messages to the people who came to ask questions of the god. She sat on a cauldron above an opening in the ground. The pythia would fall into a trance. Priests would record anything the pythia said and this was interpreted as a message from the god.
