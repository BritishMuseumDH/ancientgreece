Icarus 
</h3>

This stretch of water is named after Icarus. Icarus' father made him wings of feathers and wax. His father warned him not to fly too close to the sun. Icarus didn't listen to his father and as he flew higher and higher the wax began to melt. Icarus fell out of the sky and into the sea near Crete.
