Ephesos
</h3>

The temple of Artemis at Ephesos was one of the most important religious sites in Asia Minor.  Artemis Ephesia was worshipped there. The goddess looks very different to the representations of Artemis in mainland Greece. The goddess is covered in many egg-like breasts. The temple burnt down in 356 BC and had to be rebuilt. The new temple became one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
