Dodona
</h3>

Dodona was the site of an oracle of Zeus. People would come to ask Zeus a question. They would inscribe their query on a piece of lead. A priestess or priest would take the query and ask the god. Zeus was thought to respond when a sacred oak tree 'spoke' to the priestess. This may have been through the rustling of the leaves or the cooing of the doves in its branches. The god may even have spoken through the clanging of cauldrons. The priestess would interpret the god's answer and give it to the person.
