&beg=The Odyssey was created by the storyteller Homer.  The story describes the Greek hero Odysseus' journey home from the <font color="#660000"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/t/trojanwar.html','glos')">Trojan War</a></u></font>. This tale is as popular now as it was in ancient Greece. Homer describes many fantastic lands in the story.  For thousands of years people have enjoyed trying to guess the 'real' locations of the weird and wonderful places Odysseus visited. 

&intro=Odysseus was the king of Ithaka. His cleverness and cunning helped the Greeks win the <font color="#660000"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/t/trojanwar.html','glos')">Trojan War</a></u></font>. The Odyssey is the story of his voyage home from Troy to Ithaka and the adventures that happened on the way.
&notes01=Troy is in modern Turkey at the mouth of the Dardanelles - a channel which leads into the Black Sea. Today Troy sits on a hill overlooking a plain. Three thousand years ago it was much closer to the coastline than it is today.  Historians believe that Troy became an important and wealthy city because of its position. It helped pilot the many ships trading in the Black Sea through the dangerous Dardanelles

&page2=Odysseus' ships were blown off course by a terrible storm.  The storm raged for nine days. They were utterly lost.
&notes02=There is a very old Greek proverb that says, 'When you round Cape Maleia forget the folks at home'.  The waters around the cape are very rough and many sailors have lost their lives here.  

&page3=They eventually landed at an island.  A few of Odysseus' men went inland to explore. They met some island-dwellers, who gave them a strange fruit to taste. The fruit made the men feel lazy and forget all thoughts of returning home. Odysseus eventually had to drag them off the island and on to the ship.
&notes03=In 'The Odyssey' Homer says that a north-westerly wind blew them across the open sea.  This has led many people to believe that the Island of the Lotus-eaters lay on the coast of Libya or on the isle of Jerba. 

&page4=Their next landfall was a very pleasant and fertile island. It was the home of the Cyclopes. These creatures were terrifying, one-eyed giants. While exploring the island, Odysseus and his men were captured by Polyphemus, the most cruel of all the Cyclopes.
&page4b=He kept them trapped in his cave with his sheep and each evening ate one of the men for his tea. Odysseus escaped when he heated a pointed stake and plunged it deep into the eye of the monster.   
&notes04=There are many theories as to where the island of the Cyclopes may have been. Most people believe it was either Sicily or one of the islands surrounding it. Other people have compared the lifestyle of the Cyclopes to the people who lived in the mountains of central Italy. They too grazed sheep and lived in caves. 
&caption4=This vase shows Odysseus and his men just before they blind the sleeping Polyphemus.

&page5=After many days they came to the land of the Laestrygonians. This strange place had very long days and extremely short nights. The people of the land were huge and bloodthirsty. They attacked Odysseus and his 12 ships. Only one of Odysseus' ships managed to escape from the island.
&notes05=Homer says in 'The Odyssey' that in the land of the Laestrygonians 'morning and nightfall tread so closely on each other's heels that a man who could do without sleep might earn double wages'. Some people have compared this place to the lands of the far north of Europe - Finland, Norway and Sweden. Here, in summer, darkness only lasts for a short time, some nights it doesn't become dark at all!  However it is very unlikely that ancient travellers would have travelled this far away from their home. 

&page6=Odysseus and his men visited many more lands. They went to the island of the witch Circe, who turned Odysseus' crew into pigs. They went to the Land of the Cimmerians, where Odysseus found the entrance to the land of the dead. He conjured up the spirit of the dead prophet Teiresias who gave advice on how to get home.
&notes06=In the time of Homer, the Cimmerians lived to the north of the Black Sea. Homer describes the land as being covered in mist with rivers of ice and fire. This has led some people to believe that the Cimmerian land may have been Iceland!

&page7=Odysseus then had to pass by a number of dangerous obstacles. First his ship had to pass the island of the Sirens. The Sirens were hideous creatures who captured people by singing to them. Their voices were so beautiful that no man could resist them. 
&page7b=Odysseus made his men plug their ears with wax so they would not be tempted. However, Odysseus wanted to hear the famous singing. So he had his men bind him to the mast of the ship so he could not escape.
&notes07=Many people place the island of the Sirens in the Lipari Islands. These were volcanic islands off the north coast of Sicily.
&caption7=The painting on this vase shows Odysseus tied to the mast of his ship while the Sirens try to lure the men to their death.

&page8=A short while later they saw two high rocks rising out of the sea. The summit of the highest rock was covered in smoke. This was the home of Scylla, a horrible monster with six heads and three rows of teeth. Beside the rock opposite was Charybdis, a whirlpool that sucked down anything that travelled near it. Odysseus had to sail between the two rocks.
&page8b= The ship crept past Charybdis, but Odysseus and his men could not escape Scylla. She swooped down from her lair at the top of the rock.  Each one of her heads grabbed a man in its mouth and disappeared back to the smoky summit.
&notes08=Most people agree that Homer based this section on sailors' tales of travelling through the Straits of Messina. This channel between Sicily and Italy had very treacherous currents.  Homer says that Scylla's mountain was always covered with a cloud of smoke. This could be a reference to Mt Etna, one of the world's most active volcanoes.

&page9=Odysseus' ship and all of his men were destroyed in a terrible storm that Zeus sent as a punishment for eating the god Helios' cattle.  
&page9b=Odysseus alone survived and he was washed up on the island of the nymph Calypso. She fell in love with Odysseus and made him stay with her for many years.  Zeus sent Hermes to persuade Calypso to release Odysseus. Reluctantly she helped him make a small boat and sent him on his way.
&notes09=Homer describes Calypso's island as a paradise on earth. He also says it lies at the centre of the sea, far away and remote. Again there are many theories about where this island could be. Malta, Sardinia and one of the Lipari Islands have all been suggested as Calypso's home. However it's probable that Homer invented this island that seems like heaven on earth.
&caption9=This vase shows the sun god Helios driving his chariot across the sky.

&page10=Poseidon saw him travelling home towards Ithaka. He was angry with Odysseus because he had blinded his son Polyphemus. Poseidon whipped up the seas, and soon Odysseus' craft was pounded to smithereens by the huge waves.
&notes10=Ithaka, Odysseus' home, lies off the west coast of mainland Greece. It is a very rocky island, with a few stony beaches. 

&page11=He was washed up on the shore of Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians. The Phaeacians were kind to him and invited him to a great banquet. Odysseus told them about all the calamities that had happened to him since leaving Troy. The King of the Phaeacians ordered that their fastest boat should be made ready immediately.
&notes11=Traditionally it was believed that the land of the Phaeacians was based on the Greek island of Corfu. It is quite close to Ithaka on the western side of the Greek mainland.

&page12=After twenty long years Odysseus eventually reached the shores of his home, Ithaka.<br><br>Although his adventures weren't quite over yet...
