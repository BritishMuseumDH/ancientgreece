&page1=xxxTonight is a very special occasion. We are performing a sacrifice to Athena. Everyone has gathered together to join in the procession. We've all washed and dressed and put on our best robes. I hold a garland and others hold ribbons.

&page1b=A sacrifice was one of the most important ways to honour the gods. A sacrifice meant that an animal would be killed and offered up to a god. The event would usually begin with a procession. People would dress in their best clothes. The two people shown here hold garlands, these are wreaths made of twigs or small branches.

&page2=Goats and bulls are led to the altar. They are very fine animals. I spent all day tying ribbons onto our goat, and painting his horns. Our goat was not too happy about all the attention.  He kicked and fidgeted all day!

&page2b=The animals that were to be sacrificed had to be very healthy. A sickly animal would have been an insult to the gods. Domestic animals, like sheep, bulls, goats, hens and oxen, were the most common animal to be used at these ceremonies.

Sacrificial animals were often decorated with ribbons and their horns were painted with gold. This storage jar shows women preparing oxen for sacrifice.

&page3=As we make our procession, musicians play beautiful music. Someone plays a mournful melody on the aulos. He is accompanied by others playing the kithara and the lyre. 

&page3b=Music was an important part of the ritual. This musician on the bowl plays a double flute or an aulos. Athena herself was believed to have invented the aulos.

&page4=Some people carry water jugs. They'll use them later to sprinkle water on our heads and on to the heads of the animals. It is a sign that we are pure in the sight of Athena.

&page4b=Water was used at the climax of the ceremony. The heads of the attendees and the sacrifice victim were sprinkled with water when the procession reached the altar.

&page5=The sacrificial bull is near the head of the procession. It too has been decorated and painted.  It's the best bull in the herd and will provide a wonderful feast. 

&page5b=Bulls were a favourite sacrificial animal of Athena.  The most noble sacrificial animal was the ox. The most common sacrificial animal was the sheep.

&page6=My aunt heads the procession. It is a great honour for her to be chosen for this role. She carries a basket full of barley and oats. She has hidden the knife that will be used later, in this basket.

&page6b=Usually a young girl was chosen to perform this role. The girl also had to be unmarried.

Knives, like this Roman one, were used in sacrifices. 

&page7=Finally we've reached the altar. The music stops and silence falls.  The cow is led into the sacred circle around the altar. We all go to my aunt and take a handful of grain from her basket. I say a silent prayer to Athena; everyone closes their eyes as they make their own appeals to the goddess. Then we throw our grain into the circle and over the cow.

&page7b=Here we see the altar. Altars were normally made out of brick or stone blocks. A metal plate lay in the centre of the altar on which the fire burnt. Larger altars had steps on one side so the priest could mount the altar to lay portions of meat on the fire.

&page8=A priest comes to the altar. He holds in one hand the water vessel and in the other he hides the knife. 

&page9=There is not a sound as the priest holds the water vessel high over the cow. He pours the water onto the cow's head. As the cold water hits, the cow shakes its head from side to side. An excited whisper goes round the crowd; we know what will happen next.

&page9b=Water was sprinkled on the animal's head which made it shake or nod its head. This was taken as a sign that the animal 'agreed' to be the sacrificial victim.

&page10=The priest drops the water jug and holds up the knife. Quickly, he cuts the beast's throat. One of the women in the group lets out a cry; the other women in the crowd join in with the wailing and moaning. 

&page10b=At the climax of the sacrifice the cow's throat was cut; its blood was sprayed over the altar and into a bowl. The women attendees would scream and cry as the blood covered the sacred circle.  

&page11=The men set about carving the carcass.  The bones and the fat of the animal are offered up to Athena.  We place them on the fire on the altar and we all pray that our offering will please the goddess.

&page11b=The dish shows Athena standing behind the altar, ready to receive the offerings from the people. The bones and the fat were the god's part of the sacrificial victim. {link to: Prometheus' trick.html} Why? The bones and fat were placed on the fire on the altar. The gods were believed to especially enjoy the smells from the sacrifices.

&page12=Now the feast can begin! Wine is poured for all the participants. The meat is cooked and divided for us all. The music and entertainment starts again. I eat and drink until I am full.  

&page12b=Once the goddess had received her part of the sacrifice a feast could begin.  Often the meat of the sacrificial victim was consumed at the location of the ritual. The sacrifice was an important occasion for the whole community.
