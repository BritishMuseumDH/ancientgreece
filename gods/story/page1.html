Tonight is a very special occasion. We are performing a sacrifice to Athena. Everyone has gathered together to join in the procession. We've all washed and dressed and put on our best robes. I hold a garland and others hold ribbons.

A sacrifice was one of the most important ways to honour the gods. A sacrifice meant that an animal would be killed and offered up to a god. The event would usually begin with a procession. People would dress in their best clothes. The two people shown here hold garlands, these are wreaths made of twigs or small branches.
