<h3>The Centre of the City</h3>

<p>
At the centre of many towns and cities in ancient Greece was a hill or rocky mound called an acropolis, a Greek word meaning 'high city.' People would retreat to the acropolis in times of attack or danger.
</p>
<p>
In earlier times, palaces were sometimes constructed on top of the acropolis, but later, temples were built there where they stood out and could be easily protected.
</p>
<p>
The most famous acropolis was in Athens. In 480 BC, the temples on top of the Acropolis were destroyed by the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/persians.html','glos')" title="glossary term in a new window">Persians</a>. They were left in ruins as a war memorial. However by the second half of the fifth century BC, Athens had grown wealthy. Under the leadership of <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/perikles.html','glos')" title="glossary term in a new window">Perikles</a>, citizens agreed to a huge building programme and new temples were designed.
</p>
<p>
The goddess Athena, the main <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/patrondeity.html','glos')" title="glossary term in a new window">patron deity</a> of Athens, continued to be worshipped on the Acropolis, along with other gods and heroes.
