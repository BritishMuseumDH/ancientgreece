title=The Centre of the City

&intro=The Acropolis at Athens is world famous for its elegant temples and proud buildings. Explore a 3D model of the Acropolis, and discover the art, architecture and different uses of the buildings situated there. 

&intro2=At the centre of many towns and cities in ancient Greece was a hill or rocky mound called an acropolis, a Greek word meaning 'high city.' People would retreat to the acropolis in times of attack or danger.<br><br>In earlier times, palaces were sometimes constructed on top of the acropolis, but later, temples were built there where they stood out and could be easily protected.<br><br>The most famous acropolis was in Athens. In 480 BC, the temples on top of the Acropolis were destroyed by the Persians. They were left in ruins as a war memorial. However by the second half of the fifth century BC, Athens had grown wealthy. Under the leadership of Perikles, citizens agreed to a huge building programme and new temples were designed.<br><br>The goddess Athena, the main patron deity of Athens, continued to be worshipped on the Acropolis, along with other gods and heroes.

&prop_date=Date: Built between 438 BC and 432 BC

&prop_arch=Architect: Mnesikles

&prop_func=The Propylaia was the entrance to the Acropolis.  It acted as a gateway between the land of humans and the land of the gods on the Acropolis. 

&prop_art=The Propylaia is an impressive building in itself, and was designed to draw admiration from those who walked through it. The gateway was built on two different levels because of the uneven ground.<br><br>The walls of the north wing were decorated with painted panels, which is why it was called the Pinakotheke, meaning 'art gallery.'<br><br>Panel paintings were only really found in public buildings, and were rarely used to decorate people's homes.

&parth_func=The Parthenon is the largest and most important building on the Acropolis.  It was the temple built for Athena Parthenos, the virgin goddess.<br><br>Worship did not actually take place in Greek temples. They were built as a home to the statue of the god or goddess. Sacrifices and other rituals happened outside, around open-air altars. 

&parth_art=The Parthenon was richly decorated with sculptures. Inside was the great gold and ivory statue of Athena Parthenos. The sculptor Phidias covered the statue with pure gold, which he made sure could be removed if Athens was in need of it.<br><br>The Parthenon, the centrepiece of the Acropolis, is a Doric building with Ionic features mixed in. There were eight columns along the front, and seventeen on each side, which was more than for most Doric temples.<br><br>The decoration on the Parthenon is organised into three elements: there are two triangular pediments at either end, panels called metopes around the outer wall, and a carved stone frieze on the outside of the inner building.

The site of the altar for Athena Polias can only be guessed at today from cuttings in the rock.<br><br>During the Panathenaia festival, a large herd of cattle would have been sacrificed on the altar. Only the parts which couldn't be eaten were burnt for the gods. The meat was later given to the people of Athens for a big shared meal.
