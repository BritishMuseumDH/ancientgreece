<h2>An Ancient Greek Lunch</h2>

<p>
<span class="subtitle">Objectives:</span><br>
To understand what foods were eaten by the ancient Greeks and how they dressed.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Materials:</span><br>
Two rectangular sheets of cloth for each child in the class. Ropes or ribbons. Safety pins.  Olive oil, olives, grapes, grape juice, bread. The following items are optional: figs, raisins, almonds, garlic, apples, pears, cabbage, peas, lentils, onion, tomatoes, fish, goat's cheese, honey.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Class set-up:</span><br>
Set up a table to have your lunch
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Vocabulary:</span><br>
preserved, <i>chiton</i>
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Activity:</span><br>
Announce that today in class you'll have lunch like the ancient Greeks. Ask the children to find out as much about the food that ancient Greeks ate. List the foods on the board. 
</p>
<p>Tell the children that before they can have lunch like the ancient Greeks, they must be dressed like the ancient Greeks. Take one of the children and demonstrate to the others how to put on a <i>chiton</i>. You can put the <i>chiton</i> over the children's robes.</p>

<p>The <i>chiton</i> is made up of one long rectangular piece of material. Fold the material around the child under one side of their body under the arm.  Pin the material over the shoulders and the open material at the other side of the body.  Use the rope or ribbon to tie the material to the child's waist. Explain that men and boys would wear a short <i>chiton</i> that stopped at the knee. Women, girls and old people wore longer <i>chitons</i>.</p>

<p>Divide the class into pairs and let them help each other to dress.</p>

<p>When they are finished they can come up to the lunch table and eat some of the food. Tell the children that the grape juice is a substitute for wine. Questions to ask the children while they are having their lunch might be - what type of foods are missing (meat was very expensive and rarely eaten at home) and what type of foods they would miss if they lived on the ancient Greek diet.</p>

<p>
<span class="subtitle">Extensions:</span><br>
Get the children to write a review of their ancient Greek lunch.  What did they enjoy, what did they not like. How was it different to the food they are used to?
