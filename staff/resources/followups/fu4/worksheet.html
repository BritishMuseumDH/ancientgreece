<h2>Newspaper Reports</h2>

<p>
<span class="subtitle">Objectives:</span><br>
For the children to demonstrate their understanding of historical events. To re-write events using their own opinions. To write for different audiences.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Materials:</span><br>
Desktop publishing programs, a collection of newspapers and magazines.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Class set-up:</span><br>
Ideally small groups, either creating their own newspaper front pages, or contributing to a whole class newspaper.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Vocabulary:</span><br>
Layout.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Activity:</span><br>
Discuss why newspapers are important.
</p>

<p>Discuss the purpose of a museum with pupils. Ask them to think about their experiences with museums. </p>

<p><i>What is a museum? <br>
How is a museum used? <br>
Why are museums important? <br>
Who goes to a museum? <br>
What does the audience want to see?<br>
How do newspapers get information?<br>
How is the language in newspapers different from other sources such as history books, diaries, etc.?<br>
How can you make the account relevant and interesting?</i></p>

<p>The activity could use accounts of archaeological discoveries or the newspapers could be transported back to represent daily life and happenings in ancient Greece.  You could perhaps ask them to write a newspaper account of the Battle of Thermopylae or Plataea, as detailed in the Persian War chapter.</p>

<p>The simplest way to control this activity is to use a DTP program like Publisher, where the children can see how much space they have or it can be controlled by the teacher, using ICT also allows the children to easily correct mistakes and make their work presentable quickly.</p>

<p>The children can include their own drawings of site plans, maps or objects in the finished article.</p>
