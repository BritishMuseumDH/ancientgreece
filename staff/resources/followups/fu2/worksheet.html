<span class="subtitle">Activity:</span><br>
After looking through the website or a visit to a museum with a good collection of Greek vases, ask the children if they can name what kind of things are often portrayed on Greek vases. Myths? Sports? Banqueting? Everyday life? 
</p>

<p>Then ask the children if they noticed any other similarities on the vases apart from the figured scenes. Are there any similar motifs or shapes?</p>

<p>The children can now design their own Greek vase. You could perhaps divide the class and have different groups try a myth, another group tries a sport, and so on. </p>

<p>
<span class="subtitle">Extensions:</span><br>
More able children to could find out about the different styles of Greek vase e.g. Geometric, Black Figure, Red Figure.
