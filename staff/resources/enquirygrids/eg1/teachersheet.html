<div class=type>Enquiry Grid 1</div>

<h2>What armour and weapons were used in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Chapter/s and section/s used:</span><br>
Persian Wars chapter - Explore section
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Individual project:</span><br>
Children work through the Explore section, to find out who took part in the battle of Plataia, what weapons they used and what armour they wore. They can then each complete the enquiry grid.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Class project:</span><br>
Individually or in pairs, the class works through the Explore to find out about the soldiers, their weapons and armour. The class is then divided into small groups. Each group is given one of the 3 types from the grid below to focus on. They will then complete the enquiry grid for their 'type'. They can then feed back to the rest of the class and discuss the similarities and differences between the forces on the battlefield.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Extensions:</span><br>
More able children could be asked to read the War Story about the battle of Thermopylae. Using this story, the extracts from Herodotus, the objects and illustrations, they could then infer evidence to fill in the enquiry grid for this battle (they won't be able to do the cavalry as none took part in the Battle of Thermopylae).
