<h2>The Acropolis</h2>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Chapter/s and section/s used:</span><br>
Acropolis chapter - Explore section
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Individual project:</span><br>
Children will use the above section to explore the buildings and other features on the Acropolis in Athens. They will use the enquiry grid to record what they find out about each feature; in particular, how it was used and what decorative or architectural elements are used in the feature. (Please note that for some features there is no information about decoration, in which case the focus is on the architecture of the feature, how it looks etc.)
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Class project:</span><br>
The class is split into groups, with each group carrying out an in-depth study of one building or feature on the Acropolis, using this section of the website and this activity as a starting point for further study.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Extensions:</span><br>
More able children could be asked to identify whether temples on the Acropolis are Ionic or Doric. They could then find out more about these two architectural orders, or styles and find other examples of Ionic or Doric buildings. The Acropolis Challenge could be used to support this extension activity.
