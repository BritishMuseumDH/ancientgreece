<div class=type>Enquiry Grid 6</div>

<h2>What are the similarities and differences between the ancient and modern Olympic Games?</h2>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Chapter/s and section/s used:</span><br>
Festivals and Games Chapter - Story section
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Individual project:</span><br>
This links with QCA Unit 15, section 6. Children work through the above section to find out about the ancient Games. Encourage them to work carefully through each day and each event on that day. They will then need to explore some information about the modern Olympics, which will need to be sourced. Once they have done this, they can complete the enquiry grid to find the similarities and differences between the ancient and modern games.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Class project:</span><br>
The enquiry grid could be used as part of a whole class teaching session, by making use of an overhead projector. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Extensions:</span><br>
Children could use the model of Olympia to draw their own plan of the site, labelling the areas and devising a key to show what events happened where.
