<h2>What are the similarities and differences between democracy in ancient Athens and democracy today?</h2>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Objectives:</span><br>
To understand what democracy meant in ancient Athens and what it means today. To compare what it meant to be a citizen in Athens with what it means to be a citizen in our country.  This would be a good follow up discussion to the Key Stage 2 unit on Citizenship.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Materials:</span><br>
Athens Explore and Challenge, local government websites
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Vocabulary:</span><br>
democracy, citizen, responsibility, metic, slave
</p>
<p>
Ask children to recap on who represents people in their community and how those people are chosen. Ask the children to find out who can choose these representatives (most local government boroughs have advice on who is eligible to vote on their websites). The children can then fill in the first three questions in the enquiry grid under the section 'Democracy in our country'.
</p>
<p>
Now ask them to compare this with ancient Athens. The three key questions are: who represents the people, how are the representatives chosen and who can choose these representatives. For each of these questions they should fill in the relevant section of the enquiry grid.
</p>
<p>
As a class you can now discuss the differences between democracy now and in ancient Athens. Children can then fill in this section on their worksheet. Discuss whether Athens really was a democracy since so many people were excluded from the vote.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Extensions:</span><br>
The children could have a debate on which democratic system is better and why.
