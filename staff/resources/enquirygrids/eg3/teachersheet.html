<div class=type>Enquiry Grid 3</div>

<h2>What were the lives of boys and girls like in ancient Greece?</h2>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Chapter/s and section/s used:</span><br>
Daily Life and Sparta chapters
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Individual project:</span><br>
Each child will need to spend some time looking at the Daily Life Story and Challenge (the Explore also contains some relevant information) and the Sparta Challenge (the Story also touches on relevant details). They could make some notes about children's lives from these. Each child then needs to choose either Spartan OR Athenian girls and either Spartan OR Athenian boys to focus on in the activity. Children could perhaps pair-up to cover the four options. They can then complete the enquiry grid below. They will need another piece of paper to complete the activity (see bottom of the enquiry grid).
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Class project:</span><br>
Photocopy the worksheet below onto both sides of an A4 sheet and give each child a copy. Then, in small groups of four, each child focuses on one of the four options mentioned above, filling in one column of the worksheet as appropriate. They can then come together as a group to share what they have found out, with each child filling in the other columns of the worksheet as necessary. They then identify and discuss the similarities and differences between the lives of their chosen groups.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Extensions:</span><br>
Children could produce their own timeline for a chosen individual, following the format of the Daily Life Story and showing the key events of their childhood and adulthood.
