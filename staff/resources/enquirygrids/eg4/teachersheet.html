<div class=type>Enquiry Grid 4</div>

<h2>What materials last?</h2>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Chapter/s and section/s used:</span><br>
Whole site
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Individual project:</span><br>
Introduce the activity by discussing materials with pupils and brainstorming a list of categories of materials such as wood, metal and stone. Then ask them to imagine they are conservators doing a survey of objects to see what types of materials are represented in a collection of ancient Greek artefacts. Have them collect information from the site using the enquiry grid to record their evidence. When they have finished, ask them to put the evidence they found into categories. Have them present what they learnt in the form of a chart or poster.
(This section/activity will tie in nicely with Science and Design and Technology investigations questioning the properties of materials and the suitability of materials for making objects.)

<span class="subtitle">Class project:</span><br>
Introduce the activity by discussing materials with pupils and brainstorming a list of categories of materials such as wood, stone and metal. Split the class into groups, assigning a category to each group. Then ask them to imagine they are conservators doing a survey of objects to see what types of materials are represented in a collection of ancient Greek artefacts. Have them collect information from the site using the enquiry grid to record their evidence. Ask each group to learn more about their category of materials from the rest of the site, or from books, and make a short, illustrated presentation to the class.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Extensions:</span><br>
Ask pupils to make a class list of all the objects in their classroom that they think might last for a long time. What might archaeologists find, what might they deduce about the pupils and their lives from those objects, what would they not be able to learn about the pupils, the pupils' lives, habits and culture from those objects?
