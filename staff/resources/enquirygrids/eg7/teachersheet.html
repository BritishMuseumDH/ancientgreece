<h2>Worshipping Gods and Goddesses</h2>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Chapter/s and section/s used:</span><br>
All sections of the website
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Individual project:</span><br>
Children will use the site (or perhaps only one chapter each) to find evidence of the ways people worshipped or honoured the gods.  They can use the table to record the information.

</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Class project:</span><br>
Divide the class into groups. Give each group a number of chapters to analyse. Ask them to find evidence of the ways people worshipped the gods. They can use the table to record the information. Bring the whole class together to discuss all the ways that people paid tribute to the gods.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Extensions:</span><br>
It may not always be clear from the website why people performed certain acts for the gods. This could form the basis of a class discussion.
