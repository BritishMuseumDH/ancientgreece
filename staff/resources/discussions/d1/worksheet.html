<h2>Learning from Objects</h2>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Objectives:</span><br>
To be able to find out about the past from a range of sources of information, including artefacts; to understand that Sparta also produced works of art, despite her reputation as a 'war machine'.
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Materials:</span><br>
Sparta chapter - Story section
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Class set-up:</span><br>
Whole class work, using a projector or interactive whiteboard if available; or could be done with small groups sat around a computer
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Vocabulary:</span><br>
Sparta, materials, craftsmen, bronze, ivory
</p>
<p>
<span class="subtitle">Discussion:</span><br>
Read through the story together; at the last page, go through each of the objects displayed and read the captions. Ask:</p>
<ul><li>What do these objects tell us about life in Sparta?</li></ul>
<p>
(Answers at this stage can be quite literal e.g. Spartans worshipped a god called Aristaios, they were soldiers, girls took part in exercise, they raised sheep for wool and food. See Sparta Explore for more information on each object if needed)
</p>
<ul><li>What materials have been used to make these objects?</li>
<li>Do you think that they were difficult to make; would people need special skills to make these objects?</li>
<li>Do these objects appeal to you; which do you like best?</li>
<li>Having thought about these objects, do they support the message of the story we've read? </li></ul>
<p>
(i.e. at one time, Sparta made well-crafted objects, before becoming a military state)<br>
</p>
