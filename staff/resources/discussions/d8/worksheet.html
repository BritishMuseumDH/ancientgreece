<h2>What do the objects from ancient Greece 
tell us about daily life?
</h2>
<p> <span class="subtitle">Objectives:</span><br>
To explore what can be learned about lifestyles, customs and practices in ancient Greece through looking at objects </p>
<p> <span class="subtitle">Materials:</span><br>
Photographs of objects, secondary sources</p>
<p> <span class="subtitle">Class set-up:</span><br>
group discussion or small groups brainstorming then sharing ideas</p>
<p> <span class="subtitle">Vocabulary:</span><br>

<p> <span class="subtitle">Discussion:</span><br>
Ask pupils to think about what kinds of objects would or could survive for thousands of years based on materials, quality of construction and climate. Make a list of the pupils' comments on the board, or on a large sheet of paper. 
</p>
<p>
Ask pupils to think about what kinds of objects would not survive. Make a new column on your board or sheet of paper and make a list of what kinds of objects would not survive. Explain that the quality of construction is a big factor in terms of what survives and what does not survive.
</p>

<ul><li>How does this affect our view of what life in ancient Greece was like for all people?</li>

<li>What can't we learn about life in ancient Greece from surviving objects?</li>

<li>Which of the pupils' possessions might survive a thousand years? Why might these ones in particular survive?</li>

<li>What definitely wouldn't survive? Why are antiques and ancient relics so valuable and important?</li></ul>

<p>
Ask pupils to think about the value of everyday objects and imagine how different classes of people in ancient Greece would have demonstrated their place in society by their possession and display of valuable artefacts.
