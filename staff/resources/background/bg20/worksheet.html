<h2>Greek and Latin Spelling</h2>
<p>
You may notice throughout this website we use Greek and Latin spellings of certain words and names. At the present time it is more usual to find academic and scholarly works using only the Greek spelling.   We have tried to use the Greek spellings of words and names wherever possible.  However we have used Latin spelling when we believe the Greek spelling will not be recognised by the children using the website.
