<h2>Astronomy</h2>

<strong>ART</strong><br><br>
<strong>General Introduction</strong>

<ul><li>Astronomy is considered to be the first science</li>
<li>The term astronomy comes from 2 Greek words; astron - 'star,' and nemein - 
'to name.'</li> 
<li>Humans observed the stars for thousands of years before the Greeks - but many
of the names of stars come directly from the Ancient Greeks because they were the first astronomers to make a systematic catalogue of the stars. </li></ul>

<strong>Heritage</strong>

<ul><li>The Babylonians believed that the sun, moon, planets and stars were placed there by the gods. They observed that the stars travelled in a certain band of sky - which they divided into 12, recognizable patterns or constellations - now known as the zodiac. They named the constellations after animals / characters they recognized.</li>
<li>The Egyptians used astronomy for timekeeping only. They developed a calendar based on the solar year. </li>
<li>The Greeks combined this knowledge adding a Greek twist to some elements (see signs of the zodiac) and extending it. </li></ul>

<strong>Practicalities of Observation:</strong>

<p>All ancient astronomy relies on naked-eye observations. What could an ancient see with the naked eye?</p>

<ol>
<li>sun, moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn</li>
<li>1000s of stars - of which only about 1000 were identifiable in groups - namely the 48 ancient constellations which were formalised by Ptolemy (c.AD100 - 178)</li>
<li> Occasional phenomena - e.g. eclipses, comets and shooting stars.</li></ol>

<p>All ancients (the Greeks included) had a geocentric view of the universe i.e., the assumption that the earth was at the centre of the universe with planets orbiting it. </p>

<p>However, after close observation over a period of years, the Greeks (and others - the Babylonians...?) could deduce that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stars share a uniform wheeling movement from east to west - on curved orbits.</li> 
<li>Some stars have large orbits & are visible throughout the night - whilst others have small orbits, visible only for a short time. Some stars are constantly visible.</li>
<li>Different starts are prominent during different seasons.</li></ol>


<strong>Summary of the Greeks' relation to the stars:</strong>
<ol>
<li>The stars were deemed to have celestial significance - the Greeks adopted the
Babylonian tradition of naming their planets and stars after gods with 'similar'
characteristics. </li>

<li>The science of astronomy grew out of a belief in astrology - the power of the planets and stars to affect life on earth. Each planet was believed to have the personality and power of one of the gods. e.g. Mars = god of war - associated with war, plague, famine and violent death. </li>

<li>The term astrology comes from the Greek words, astron meaning 'star,' and logos meaning 'the science.' The signs of the zodiac were developed by the Babylonians. The Greeks adopted and adapted the zodiac signs. </li>

<li>The stars were used as gigantic clocks to measure the changes in the seasons. </li></ol>
