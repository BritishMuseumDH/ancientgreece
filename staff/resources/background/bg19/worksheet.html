<h2>Work and Agriculture</h2>

<h3>Sources on agriculture - early poetry</h3>
<ul>
<li>In sources, men reared and worked with domestic animals.</li>
<li>Homer: mentions ploughing, winnowing and threshing in the Iliad. In Odyssey, have description of Laertes' development of a farmstead.</li>
<li>Hesiod's poem Works and Days contains important ideas:
    <ul class="tier2">
	<li>Farming is main work and is done by men.</li>
	<li>Women are 'naturally' fitted to work in the house e.g. textiles.</li>
	<li>Work, particularly farming, is hard and is result of the end of the Golden Age and punishment by Zeus (nature no longer spontaneously produces food).</li>
	<li>Religious and social calendars of city-states are closely linked to the patterns of the agricultural year.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Hard work is seen as an unwelcome necessity imposed by Zeus.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Agriculture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Land economically of greatest value and status in terms of political, social and symbolic power.</li>
<li>Commonest cause of small scale warfare was territory.</li>
<li>Most Greeks in most states actively involved in agriculture - most were small farmers, 'peasants'.</li>
<li>Much of the land was owned by the propertied rich.</li>
<li>Farming strategies included:
    <ul class="tier2">
	<li>Fallowing</li>
	<li>Alternating cereals and legumes</li>
	<li>Multi-cropping on same field.</li>
	<li>Owning a number of small farms in different parts of a territory.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>The 3 most important products were cereals, olives and the vine.</li>
<li>Hilly ground was terraced.</li>
<li>Kept grazing and working animals - used to work land, produce manure and for food, sometimes for leather.</li>
<li>Pigs were an important part of animal husbandry.</li>
<li>Workforce for farms included many slaves in Athens, Corinth, Chios and other major city-states.</li>
<li>In Sparta, subject Greeks, the helots, formed major labour force for farming.</li>
<li>In Athens, seems most farmland was controlled by the propertied rich, managed in separate units. Sometimes leased land to tenants but all made use of slaves.</li>
<li>The olive was fundamental to Greek agriculture and became symbol of the identity of Athens.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trade</h3>
<ul>
<li>Surplus agricultural produce was exchanged for imported necessities e.g. metals.</li>
<li>When there was a poor harvest, staple cereals may be imported.</li>
<li>From early 6th century coinage was introduced making exchanges easier.</li>
<li>Money changers/bankers exchanged between the many coinages used by different city-states.</li>
<li>Markets were held in the agorai.</li>
<li>Most traders operated on a small scale, owning one ship.</li>
<li>A gulf existed between the economic worlds of farming and trade, as traders were mostly metics so couldn't own land.</li>
<li>Quarrying and mining were found in abundance in some city states.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Crafts and manufacturing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Craft industries seem to have involved smaller working groups - often a craftsman with a few slaves producing sculpture and pottery.</li>
<li>Cottage industries - owner and slaves living in the house where work was done.</li>
<li>Textile production mostly done by women in the household - either do themselves or supervise slaves.</li>
<li>Poorer women might work in the fields or sell their husband's produce in a shop or market stall.</li>
<li>Some manufacturing workshops were on a larger scale: many manufacturing slaves (particularly in Athens) lived and worked independently in shops/houses.</li>
<li>Many slaves involved in trade also lived and worked independently.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Slavery and work ideology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Slave or serf labour in nearly all sectors of city-state economies - affected attitudes to work of free population.</li>
<li>Poorer farmers, craftsmen and retailers hoped to buy their own slaves.</li>
<li>The groups above would not wish to engage in slavish work i.e. working for another person long term.</li>
<li>Farmers looked down on craftsmen and traders (weren't land owners)</li>
<li>Wealthy looked down more on those in manufacture/trade than on poor farmers.</li>
<li>Only the very poor would undertake wage labour as this had slave connotations.</li>
</ul>
