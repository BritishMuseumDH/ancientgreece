<h2>Religion and Burial</h2>

<strong>A common set of beliefs</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>Religion gave Greeks a sense of shared identity.
</li>
<li>Greeks across the Greek world knew same myths, though some places linked to 
	a particular myth.
</li>
<li>Same gods worshipped, generally with the same rituals, across Greek world.</li>

<li>Temples across Greece differed very little.</li>

<li>Greeks worshipped by sacrificing animals, offering prayers and singing/dancing.</li>

<li>Making sacrifices was the most important ritual: highest offering was a bull but 
	also offered other animals, food and wine. Offerings were made to ask for or say 
	thanks for a favour, or to mark a special event.</li>

<li>Religious practices such as the use of oracles were shared by all Greeks.</li>

<li>Greeks from across the Greek world attended festivals.</li>

<li>Magic also played an important role in religion.</li></ul>


<strong>The role of the gods</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>They didn't represent goodness and perfection.</li>

<li>Could be violent, jealous, adulterous and inflict suffering on humans.</li>

<li>They expected prayers and sacrifices from humans.</li>

<li>In return for the above, mortals could ask for and expect favours from the gods.</li>

<li>The gods couldn't override fate.</li></ul>



<strong>Festivals and Games</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>Festivals and games were held to honour the gods, but were also fun occasions.</li>

<li>In Athens, festival events were held on about &frac12; the days of the year.</li>

<li>Athletic, music and drama competitions were part of important festivals.</li>

<li>Festivals included song & dance, a procession to the temple and sacrifices.</li>

<li>Important festivals included the Dionysia, Panathenaea, & Thesmophoria.</li>

<li>Most festivals took place once a year, or sometimes every 4 years.</li>

<li>Sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi was site of the Pythian Games: had a stadium built
above Apollo's temple.</li>

<li>Olympic Games were part of an important festival to honour Zeus: held every 4 years at Olympia in the Peloponnese.</li>

<li>Separate games held at Olympia for women called the Heraea, in honour of Hera.</li>

<li>The Panathenaea was a major festival in Athens to honour the birth of Athena. Was yearly with a larger version every 4 years. Included an athletic competition.</li></ul>



<strong>Oracles</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>Played an important role in religion.</li>
<li>A way for humans to ask questions of the gods.</li>
<li>Most famous oracle was the oracle of Apollo at Delphi:
	Questions for the god were written down and given to an attendant.<br>

	A priestess would act as the mouthpiece of the god and give a prophecy, written in lines of verse.<br>

	The prophecy could be obscurely worded so could be interpreted in different ways.</li>

<li>Oracles also at Dodona (NW Greece), which took the form of an oak tree and at 
	Siwa in Egypt.
</li>
<li>Seers also made prophecies, usually based on examining the organs of a 
	sacrificed animal.
</li></ul>




<strong>Temples</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>Were houses of the deity.</li>

<li>Had political as well as religious purpose as often built to celebrate civic power 
	and pride, or give thanks to the patron god for success in war.</li>

<li>Made of limestone or marble with wooden ceilings & roof tiles of stone or 
	terracotta.</li>

<li>A great temple of Zeus stood at Olympia.</li>

<li>During festivals & special occasions, people gathered to perform sacrifices at 
	the temple altar to honour the god.</li>

<li>The altar was outside the main temple building, which ordinary people could not 
	enter.</li>

<li>Inside the temple building was a statue of the god, tended by priests and 
	priestesses.</li>

<li>Important temples became wealthy from the gifts given to the deity.</li></ul>


<strong>Burial</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>Most people died quite young: men in battle, women in childbirth.</li>

<li>Most people buried their dead, but some were cremated on a funeral pyre.</li>

<li>The dead person was washed and dressed by women.</li>

<li>The body would remain at home for a period of mourning: the person would be laid on a couch, feet facing the door so the spirit would leave.
</li>
<li>The body would be carried to the burial on a stretcher, escorted by mourners in black robes.</li>

<li>Food & drink sometimes placed in the grave for the journey to the underworld.
</li>
<li>In the Classical period it wasn't common for objects to be buried with the person, though this did occur in earlier periods.</li>

<li>If the family could afford it, a person was buried in a coffin of wood or stone.</li>

<li>Wealthier families paid for a marble gravestone (stele), carved with portrait of the deceased.</li>

<li>Tombs were decorated with scenes of feasts and the deceased's favourite things.</li></ul>


<strong>The afterlife</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>Greeks believed in an afterlife but ideas about it varied.</li>

<li>Generally, the kingdom of the dead was thought to be deep in the earth.</li>

<li>The king of the underworld was the god Hades: the underworld came to be 
	known as Hades also.
</li>
<li>The deceased was carried across the river Styx to the underworld by the
	ferryman, Charon: the trip cost one obol and sometimes a coin was left on the 
	deceased to pay for this journey.</li>

<li>If a person was not buried his/her spirit couldn't pass into Hades.
</li>
<li>The underworld was not really a place of punishment but was thought of as a 
	Joyless place.
</li>
<li>Some heroes that were in favour with the gods were believed to journey to the 
	Isles of the Blessed, where they lived amid heavenly pleasures.</li>
</ul>
