<h2>Forms of Government - Democracy, Oligarchy and Tyranny</h2>

<strong>Democracy: rule by the people</strong><br><br>


<ul>


<li>Most government officials chosen by lottery, did job for 1 year.</li>
<li>From 390 BC, citizens paid for attending assembly.</li>
<li>Most important political posts were the 10 generals: elected by the assembly each year.</li>
<li>Between 30,000 - 40,000 male citizens but possibly only about 5000 attended assembly.</li>
<li>Voting was by a show of hands.</li>
<li>Ostracism (banishment from Athens) involved writing a person's name on an ostraca; person with most votes over 6000 had to leave Athens for 10 years, which destroyed their career.</li></ul>

<strong>Historical Developments</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>In Homer we have evidence for monarchy, but probably lasted no later than the
8th century.</li>

<li>By c.700 BC, aristocracies, not monarchies, ruling the earliest poleis.</li>

<li>Commoners challenged this position and power shifted from aristocrats to wider group of landlords.</li>

<li>Oligarchies then replaced aristocracies.</li>

<li>In 6th century particularly, tyrannies appear, including Pisistratus in Athens.</li>

<li>In 508/7, Kleisthenes reforms brought about democracy in Athens: citizenship was based on membership of a deme (village/ward).</li>

<li>In late 460s, Ephialtes and Pericles were behind a reform package passed by assembly that led to the removal of the remaining political powers of the Areopagus, the aristocratic council that had been the supreme court in Athens.</li>

<li>In 411 and 405/4, oligarchies overthrew Athenian democracy: the latter was extreme and brutal and was set up by Sparta.</li>

<li>Under Macedonian rule of Greece, tyrannies by pro-Macedonians were imposed on Athen's allies against Macedon.</li>

<li>After Alexander's death, democracy was overthrown in Athens, but continued in city of Rhodes.</li>

<li>Hellenistic kings and Rome promoted oligarchy and monarchy in Greece. </li></ul>
