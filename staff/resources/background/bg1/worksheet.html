<h2>Spartan Life</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sparta was one of the strongest city-states in Greece.</li>
<li>Was ruled by 2 kings at a time and a Council of 30 elders, who were all citizens over the age of 60.</li>
<li>In the archaic period, Sparta produced fine art and literature.</li>
<li>Was a military state.</li>
<li>Had a key role in defeating Persia.</li>
<li>Defeated Athens in the Peloponnesian War and was then at the height of her power.</li>
<li>Made a treaty with Persia, the 'King's Peace', in 386 BC.</li>
<li>Was defeated by Thebes in 371 BC, never regained supremacy.</li>
</ul>

<span class="subtitle">Life for men</span>
<ul>
<li>Spartan boys left their families at 7 to be trained to become part of the full-time professional army.</li>
<li>Had very strict education and training.</li>
<li>Boys were not well fed and punished if caught stealing food.</li>
<li>Boys were encouraged to fight each other but not in anger.</li>
<li>Cowardice was seen almost as a crime.</li>
<li>Spartan education put emphasis on physical fitness.</li>
<li>Boys were taken to the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia to be flogged to show their toughness and endurance.</li>
<li>The training of males was divided into age groups and called the ag&ocirc;g&ecirc; (upbringing):
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Boys 7- 17 learned reading, writing, dancing and singing; also tough physical education</li>
<li>Older boys, 18-19, trained for the army and in survival techniques.</li>
<li>Youths, 20-29, underwent rigorous military training as part of the standing army.</li>
<li>Young adults, 30+, were full citizens and expected to marry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A man had to remain in his barracks until he was 30 and if he married (could marry from the age of 20) he had to visit his wife in secrecy.</li>
<li>All adult men belonged to 'messes'- small groups that met and dined together and were housed in individual 'men's houses'.</li>
<li>All citizens were hoplites.</li>
</ul>

<span class="subtitle">Life for women</span>
<ul>
<li>Women received an education and physical training.</li>
<li>Physical training made them fit and strong so they would have healthy babies (to become good soldiers).</li>
<li>Physical training probably focused on gymnastics, choral song and dance.</li>
<li>Xenophon says that the legendary law-giver Lycurgus thought wool-working and the related sedentary life found in other states were best left to slave women: the activity was traditionally disdained by Spartan women.</li>
</ul>

<span class="subtitle">The Perioikoi</span><br>
(Free, non-Spartans of Laconia and Messenia)
<ul>
<li>Had to provide military service to the Spartans</li>
<li>Did not have the privileges of citizenship (e.g. member of the Spartan assembly, able to be a magistrate).</li>
<li>Were involved with the management of trade and manufacture, as Spartans not allowed to be engaged in trade.</li>
</ul>


<span class="subtitle">The Helots</span><br>
(The 'serf' population)
<ul>
<li>Were Greeks of the area around Sparta that were defeated in war by the Spartans.</li>
<li>Were owned by Spartans as a whole (not by individuals).</li>
<li>The magistrates (ephors) declared war on them annually as constant fear of revolt.</li>
<li>They provided most of the agricultural produce for the rest of the population.</li>
<li>Those of Messenia took part in regular revolts.</li>
</ul>
