<h2>Education</h2>
<br>
<strong>Athenian education</strong><br><br>

<strong>Boys</strong><br><br>
<p>Boys of 7 and up were sent to school. They were accompanied by a paidagogos - a slave from their home who would supervise their learning. They learned reading, writing, and arithmetic from a teacher called a grammatistes. </p>
<strong>Girls</strong><br><br>
<p>Girls did not attend school and were taught in the home. They would have been instructed in traditional female occupations such as weaving and spinning.  </p>
<br>
<strong>Spartan education</strong><br><br>
<strong>Education based around military need.</strong><br><br>
<p>From age 7 Spartan boys lived in barracks away from their families. All citizen adult men belonged to syskania or messes. These were small groups meeting and dining communally in individual men's houses.</p>

<strong>Historical Developments</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>In Homer we have evidence for monarchy, but probably lasted no later than the
8th century.</li>

<li>By c.700 BC, aristocracies, not monarchies, ruling the earliest poleis.</li>

<li>Commoners challenged this position and power shifted from aristocrats to wider group of landlords.</li>

<li>Oligarchies then replaced aristocracies.</li>

<li>In 6th century particularly, tyrannies appear, including Pisistratus in Athens.</li>

<li>In 508/7, Kleisthenes reforms brought about democracy in Athens: citizenship was based on membership of a deme (village/ward).</li>

<li>In late 460s, Ephialtes and Pericles were behind a reform package passed by assembly that led to the removal of the remaining political powers of the Areopagus, the aristocratic council that had been the supreme court in Athens.</li>

<li>In 411 and 405/4, oligarchies overthrew Athenian democracy: the latter was extreme and brutal and was set up by Sparta.</li>

<li>Under Macedonian rule of Greece, tyrannies by pro-Macedonians were imposed on Athen's allies against Macedon.</li>

<li>After Alexander's death, democracy was overthrown in Athens, but continued in city of Rhodes.</li>

<li>Hellenistic kings and Rome promoted oligarchy and monarchy in Greece. </li></ul>
