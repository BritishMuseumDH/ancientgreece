<h2>Education</h2>
<br>
<strong>Athenian education</strong><br><br>

<strong>Boys</strong><br><br>
<p>Boys of 7 and up were sent to school. They were accompanied by a paidagogos - a slave from their home who would supervise their learning. They learned reading, writing, and arithmetic from a teacher called a grammatistes. </p>
<strong>Girls</strong><br><br>
<p>Girls did not attend school and were taught in the home. They would have been instructed in traditional female occupations such as weaving and spinning.  </p>
<strong>Spartan education</strong><br><br>
<strong>Education based around military need.</strong><br><br>
<p>From age 7 Spartan boys lived in barracks away from their families. All citizen adult men belonged to syskania or messes. These were small groups meeting and dining communally in individual men's houses.</p>

<strong>Girls</strong><br><br>
<p>A modified form of physical training for Spartan girls focused on gymnastics and choral song and dance. The goal of a Spartan woman's training was to make her the mother of warriors.</p>
<strong>General </strong>
<p>Books are expensive and rare. Education is <strong>oral</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Gymnasia</strong> date to at least the 6th century BC. It was a centre for providing instruction on sport. They also became centres of learning. </p>
<p>In Athens two famous philosophical schools were set up in direct association with famous old gymnasia, the <strong>Academy</strong> and the <strong>Lyceum</strong>.</p>
<p>Academy - started by Plato</p>
<p>Lyceum - started by Aristotle.</p>
