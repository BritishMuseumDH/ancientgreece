<h2>History / Writing / Recording</h2><br>

<span class="subtitle">History</span>
<ul>
<li>Greeks were the first to take a formal interest in 'history'.</li>
<li>The word <em>history</em> comes from the Greek <em>historia</em>, meaning <em>knowledge gained from enquiry</em> (as meaning remains in contemporary, <em>Natural History</em>.) </li>
<li>History developed into a science - meant to be non-mythical.</li>
<li>History came to mean the narrative of the past.</li>
</ul>

<span class="subtitle">Significant Individuals:</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hecateus -  6th / 5th C. BC</strong><br>
First historian of any significance. Wrote 'History' and 'Tour Around the World',  fragments survive.</li>
<li><strong>Theoponus of Chios</strong><br>
The historical knowledge and record-keeping of the Egyptian priests impressed him.</li>
<li><strong>Herodotus</strong><br>
(c.484 - 425 BC) Known as the 'Father of History.' </li>
<li><strong>Thucydides</strong><br>
(c.460 - 400 BC) Herodotus' immediate successor and rival.</li>
<li><strong>Xenophone</strong><br>
Less rigorous 'historian' - but wrote in lovely Athenian prose!</li>
</ul>

<span class="subtitle">Summary</span>
<ul>
<li>&quot;...Our modern notion of history as a critical, disinterested enquiry into the significant facts of the past and a rational, objective exploration of them, is thus a legacy of Herodotus and Thucydides&quot;</li>
</ul>

<span class="subtitle">Writing:</span>
<ul>
<li>The main point to remember about the Greeks, was that theirs was an <strong>ORAL</strong> culture. </li>
<li>The Greek for <em>'to read'</em> means literally, <em>'to recognize again'.</em> Things were written down secondarily - the emphasis was on their being heard and familiar through hearing, first of all. </li>
<li>The Greek alphabet is the direct or indirect ancestor of all European alphabets. </li>
<li>The early Greek alphabet was written from right to left, but by 500 BC, all strains were written from left to right - the alphabet became uniform throughout the Greek world. </li>
<li>Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters (capitals) including 7 vowels. </li>
<li>Written Greek in its oldest form is known as <strong>Linear B</strong>, and dates from around 1400 to 1200 BC. This was deciphered by Michael Ventris in 1952. </li>
<li><strong>Linear B</strong> derives from <strong>Linear A</strong> - an ancient language from Crete and some Aegean islands, from approx. 1850 BC to 1400 BC. </li>
<li>Linear B texts are very important to Greek linguists - elements of the Ancient Greek dialect have survived in Homer's language, as a result of the long oral tradition of epic poetry.
</li>
</ul>


<span class="subtitle">Greek Literature: Different forms of writing:</span><br>
<ul>
<li><strong>ENORMOUS</strong> influence of Greek writing on the West.</li>
<li>4 major periods of Greek literature: a) preclassical, b) classical, c) Hellenistic-Roman, and d) Byzantine. Of these, the most significant works were produced during the preclassical and classical eras. 
<ol>
<li><strong>Epic Tradition:</strong> The Iliad and The Odyssey. Based on ancient legends.</li>
<li><strong>Lyric Poetry:</strong> From as early as 700 BC - a type of poetry sung to the accompaniment of a lyre. [See Sappho (610 - 580 BC), Pindar (b.510 BC)]</li>
<li><strong>Tragedy:</strong> Greeks invented drama. Hundreds of dramas written and performed during the classical age. [Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides.]</li>                      
<li><strong>Comedy:	</strong></li>
<li><strong>History:</strong> (see above).</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy:</strong>[Socrates, Plato, Aristotle]. With the death of Aristotle in 322 BC, the	classical era of Greek literature drew to a close. </li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<span class="subtitle">Recording:</span>
<ul>
<li>There is ample documentation of business, financial and legal transactions.</li>
<li>Formal documents recording religious administration and ritual and liturgical instructions.</li>
<li>Epitaphs and tomb inscriptions.</li>
</ul>
