<h2>Philosophers</h2>

<strong>The following information sheet gives a brief description of a few of the most famous ancient Greek philosophers.</strong><br><br>


<strong>
Pythagoras
</strong><br><br>
<p>Operated a kind of religious cult.
<br><br>
One of the first to come up with the idea that mathematical order pervades the physical world.
<br><br>
Introduced the idea of a square and cube of a number - thus applied geometrical concepts to arithmetic.</p>



<strong>
Socrates (b. 470 d. 399)
</strong><br><br>
<p>Quite ugly.
<br><br>
Didn't think he knew all the answers to the questions - but thought no one else did either.
<br><br>
He would take a concept and ask what it meant: eg: 'What is friendship' or 'What is courage'.
<br><br>
He would then challenge any person who thought he knew the answer through constant questioning.
<br><br>
Some certainties come through in Socrates's questioning:</p>

<ol><li>No real harm can come to someone who preserves his integrity. Real personal catastrophe comes from the corruption of the soul.</li>

<li>No one ever really knowingly does harm, because if you truly understand something is wrong in its fullest sense you wouldn't do it.  Therefore he equates virtue with knowledge.</li></ol>
He was arrested and sentenced to death for corrupting the youth.<br><br>
<strong>
Plato (c. 427-347BC )
</strong><br><br>
<p>He's the first Western philosopher whose written works remain intact. 
<br><br>
He was a student of Socrates.
<br><br>
He regarded maths and physics as the keys to understanding the natural world.
</p>
<strong>
Works (not exhaustive!!):
</strong><br><br>
<ul><li>In the Republic he explores the nature of justice, and tries to make a blueprint for the ideal state.</li>
<li>Symposium is an investigation into the nature of love.</li></ul>
He established the prototype of the college - the Academy. The word comes from the name of Plato's house.

<p>He established the prototype of the college - the Academy. The word comes from the name of Plato's house.
<br><br>
His main theory was the Theory of Forms or Ideas. He regarded everything in the world as a decaying copy of something whose ideal form has a permanent and indestructible existence outside space and time.
<br><br>
Describes his theory using The Myth of the Cave.</p>

<strong>
Aristotle: (b. 384BC d. 322BC)
</strong><br><br>


<p>He was the founder of an approach to philosophy that starts from observation and experience, prior to abstract thinking.
<br><br>
The most gifted of Plato's pupils and was the tutor of Alexander the Great.
<br><br>
355BC - founds his own school - the Lyceum.
<br><br>
He systemized logic - ie: he sorted out which forms of inference were valid or invalid.
<br><br>
He had a wide range of interests: logic, physics, political science, economics, psychology, and so on.
<br><br>
For Aristotle, 'form' is that which causes something to be the way it is. The real point of everything is what it does.
<br><br>
In Ethics - he sets out that true happiness comes from leading a balanced life, moderation in all things... The purpose of the State is to make possible the development and happiness of the individual. Being a member of society is the only way to achieve true happiness.
