<h2>Medicine</h2>

<strong>Religion and Medicine</strong><br><br>

<p>Religion and supernatural causes were linked to beliefs about the causes and cures of disease. Religious healing was an ever present alternative that was sought particularly in chronic cases eg: the epidemic that affected Athens in 430 - 427 BC helped spread the worship of <strong>Asklepios</strong>.<br><br>

In Hesiod's poetry (c. 750BC), diseases mark the end of the Golden Age. They were created because of Zeus' anger against Prometheus; and are released from Pandora's box.
</p>
<strong>Asklepios</strong><br><br>
<ul><li>Widely worshipped as a god of healing.</li>

<li>In legend Asklepios was the son of the god Apollo by a human mother (Apollo 
was also a god of healing - he causes a plague at the beginning of the Iliad).</li>

<li>By the end of the 5th century BC he had become a popular god. Many temples were built in his honour. </li>

<li>The main temple was at Epidaurus. Ill people stayed overnight there, if lucky they would have a dream in which Asklepios would offer medical advice. These dreams could be interpreted by on site healers.</li>

<li>Asklepios is often symbolised holding a staff with a snake coiled around it. The snake became a symbol of the art of medicine - its ability to renew itself by shedding its skin was associated with immortality.  </li></ul>
<strong>Hippocrates</strong><br><br>
<ul><li>He is known as the 'Father of Medicine' but very little information known about the historical Hippocrates.</li>

<li>A Hippocrates is described in Plato's Protagoras as coming 'from Kos and charging a fee for teaching people medicine.'</li>

<li>Kos was famous for its doctors.</li>

<li>In Phaedrus Plato links Hippocrates' family tree back to Asklepios.</li></ul>
<strong>The Hippocratic Corpus.</strong><br><br>
<p>These are a set of texts that date from 420 - 370BC. Attributed to Hippocrates - but in most cases this is wrong.  This collection was brought together in the library of Alexandria in around the beginning of the 3rd century BC.
</p>
<strong>Hippocratic Medicine</strong><br><br>

<p> Hippocratic medicine is easier to characterise - a description of it will normally include the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Close observation of symptoms</li>
<li>An openness to ideas from all sides.</li>
<li>A willingness to explain the causes of diseases.</li></ol>
<p>The Hippocratic oath is another element which has become associated with Hippocratic medicine (still used to this day).</p>

 <p>&quot;... I will use my power to help the sick to the best of my ability and judgement; I will abstain from harming or wronging any man by it...<br><br>... I will not give a fatal draught to anyone if I am asked, nor will I suggest any such thing...<br><br>... Whatever I see or hear, professionally or privately, which ought not to be divulged, I will keep secret and tell no one.&quot;<br><br>

Most Hippocratic texts presented fluids in the body as the main cause of disease.</p>
