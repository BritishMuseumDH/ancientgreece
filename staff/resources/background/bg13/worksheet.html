<strong>Music in Public</strong><br><br>

  <tr> 
    <td width="120"> 
      <div align="right"><ul><li><strong>Festivals</strong></li></ul></div>
    </td>
    <td>The two main festivals were the <strong>Panathenaia</strong> and the <strong>Great Dionysia</strong>.  
			The first (NB the Parthenon frieze) included a large procession of 
			musicians. In pottery, their representation is reduced to 2 aulos players 
			and 2 kithara players - on sculpture, to 4. Festivals usually involved 
			formal musical competitions with categories for soloists and choirs etc.  
			The <strong>Pythian games at Delphi</strong> were held in honour of <strong>Apollo</strong>, the 
			divine musician. Competition was fierce. Victory odes for athletic and 
			musical competition winners were composed specially.

    </td>
    <td>Music was played on the battlefields, possibly to help soldiers march in 
			time.  
Commands were given on a war trumpet. On war boats, percussion instruments (usually) were played to keep the oarsmen rowing in time. A trireme boat for example, had 170 rowers who needed to keep to a rhythm.

    </td>
    <td>Music was vital in <strong>theatre</strong>. Greek playwrights were expected to compose the music, train the singers AND direct the performance of their plays! Large amounts of the story in a Greek play was narrated in song rather than acted. 
Similarly, the performance of narrative poems was more likely to be said in a sing-song chant - NB -professional performers of Homeric poems were called <em>rhapsodes</em>.
