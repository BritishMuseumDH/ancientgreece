<h2>Theatre</h2>

<strong>The physical structure </strong><br><br>

<ul><li>Built into the side of a hill with the ground at the foot of the hill levelled out for the
	stage area.</li>

<li>Open to the sky: plays staged in daylight.</li>

<li>Stage possibly slightly raised.</li>

<li>In front of the stage was the circular orchestra, where the chorus sang and
	danced.
</li>
<li>A passageway (called the parados) ran either side of the stage to allow 
	performers to enter and exit the orchestra.
</li>
<li>The seating area could hold 15000 people and sloped down to the orchestra.</li>

<li>Behind the stage was an area for a stage building, called a 'skene'. </li>

<li>The semi-circular bowl shape of theatres provided good views and amplified 
	sound.</li>

<li>Stone theatres were built after the 5th century.</li></ul>


<strong>The plays</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>Most plays known today were written and performed in the 5th century BC.</li>

<li>Plays developed in 6th century Athens from ritual drama performances for 
	Dionysos.</li>

<li>Plays were performed in competitions between playwrights at the annual 
Athenian festival of Dionysos.</li>



<li>By the 5th century, tragedies and comedies being performed.</li>

<li>The actors were all men.</li>

<li>No more than three actors could talk to each other at one time.
</li>
<li>The chorus commented on the action of the play and addressed the audience more directly.
</li>
<li>The play would be acted out in the orchestra.</li>

<li>Plays were accompanied by music.</li>

<li>Actors wore masks with exaggerated features to suggest their character and to be seen.</li></ul>


<strong>The playwrights: tragedy</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>Three great dramatists that dominated Athenian tragic theatre in the 5th century: Aeschylus (earliest), Sophokles and Euripides.
</li>
<li>Euripides (Athenian) dealt with serious subjects including the horrors of war.</li>

<li>Euripides plays upset Athenians as they suggested the savage treatment of enemies by Athens and were daring in the treatment of myth.</li>

<li>Sophokles' plays dealt with royal and legendary families and their tragic lives e.g. King Oedipus and Electra, daughter of Agamemnon.
</li>
<li>Aeschylus' 3 plays, 'The Oresteia', also dealt with death of Agamemnon and how his son Orestes avenged him.  </li>
</ul>

<strong>The playwrights: comedy</strong><br><br>

<ul><li>Comedies dealt with contemporary themes and people, not myths.</li>

<li>Aristophanes lived in Athens and 'wrote' during the time of the Peloponnesian War: often criticised war politicians.</li>

<li>His plays discuss controversial issues e.g. role of women, value of war.</li>

<li>His comedies make use of comic slaves and servants who were favourite figures in Athenian comedy.</li>

<li>His are the only complete comedies from 5th century Greece.</li></ul>
