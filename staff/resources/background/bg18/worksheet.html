<h2>Women, Children and Slaves </h2>

<p>NB: The following focuses on life in Athens. For info on this theme as it applies to Sparta, see 'Spartan Life'.</p>

<h3>WOMEN</h3>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Religious Role
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Some festivals were restricted to citizen women; in others women had an important role.</li>
<li>Women were included in the Panathenaea: in the procession, groups of maidens head the procession but those of noble families came before those of lower status.</li>
<li>Citizen women particularly figured in rituals connected with Demeter and Kore.</li>
<li>Most prominent ritual linked to Demeter/Kore was Thesmophoria: it was exclusively female, but was only for citizen wives.</li>
<li>All of the population celebrated the Diasia, a festival of Zeus Meilichios.</li>
<li>Likely that there were other ritual occasions where women could participate e.g. public sacrifices - were spectators.</li>
<li>Women had an important role in funerals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Legal position
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Women couldn't inherit property.</li>
<li>Women could give evidence under oath under a special procedure.</li>
<li>Women didn't appear in court as jurors or as litigants (i.e. party to a lawsuit).</li>
<li>Women didn't have the opportunity to commit most crimes as were not in the public sphere.</li>
<li>Family law was handled by a woman's guardian e.g. father, husband.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Political Position
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Women could not achieve political rights, although metics (resident foreigners) and even slaves could.</li>
<li>Citizen wives shared citizen status in as much as they could have sons who were citizens and daughters who could marry citizens.</li>
<li>On the festival of the Thesmophoria, women, 'took over' the assembly: they would set up an encampment there; the council and law courts were not in session on their day of fasting; they elected their own officials for the festival.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Economic Position
<ul class="tier2">
<li>The social ideal was that a woman did not keep a shop or do market business.</li>
<li>Sources show that in wealthier households men or slaves do shopping.</li>
<li>Ideally women were absent from the agora - the central public space and core of political/judicial/economic/cultural life.</li>
<li>Reality was that wives of poorer people did visit the agora: likely that the majority of Athenians were poor.</li>
<li>Many women did work in the agora, but not clear if they were citizen women, metics or slaves.</li>
<li>Some women traded foodstuff, perfume or garlands.</li>
<li>Some women were tavern-keepers or woolworkers.</li>
<li>Women don't appear in occupations where real money could be made.</li>
<li>Many known occupations of women overlap with those of female slaves.</li>
<li>One area of commerce under female control was prostitution: courtesans were usually metics; prostitutes were mostly slaves working in brothels run by a woman or a man.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Role in the community
<ul class="tier2">
<li>All citizens were registered in a deme (mini polis): citizen women belonged to a deme through a father or husband.</li>
<li>Citizen women were active in the demes, particularly in religion.</li>
<li>Citizen women also involved in religious life of phratries - social & cultural 'fraternities' of which all citizens were members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Domestic role
<ul class="tier2">
<li>The social ideal was that (Athenian) women spent most time at home and indoors.</li>
<li>The ideal only related to a minority i.e. the wealthy.</li>
<li>Poorer women would have worked: in agriculture if from the country; in trade/shops if from town.</li>
<li>Amongst the better-off women, part of their time was spent in religious activities including festivals, so not always at home.</li>
<li>Sources do reveal that wealthy women met the ideal 'spinning wool, baking bread, keeping house'.</li>
<li>Wealthier women would learn to supervise the house slaves; guard the house provisions; budget expenditure and arrange for storing belongings neatly.</li>
<li>Women also responsible for the nurture of children.</li>
<li>Women appear in the sources to spend time together.</li>
<li>Women of wealthier families had their own quarters in the home.</li>
<li>Wealthier women had less opportunity to mix socially.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>CHILDREN: Boys</h3>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Religious role
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Citizens and sons took pride of place in most of the city's ritual occasions.</li>
<li>Were certain festivals where boys had a particular role e.g. Anthesteria.</li>
<li>Boys (and girls) were involved in choral song and dance on ritual occasions.</li>
<li>Boys (and men) took part in the athletic and musical contests of major festivals e.g. Panathenaea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Legal position
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Children were represented in court by fathers/guardians.</li>
<li>Boys could represent themselves from 18.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Political position
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Once 18 and had passed 'citizenship test', would serve in the army.</li>
<li>Could then participate in the citizen assembly</li>
<li>At 30 could hold public office or serve on a jury.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>CHILDREN: Girls</h3>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Religious role
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Involved in religious festivals e.g. Panathenaea involved citizen daughters.</li>
<li>Girls had specific ritual roles in the polis e.g. weaving the peplos for Athena, washing the cult statue, serving Artemis as acolytes in the sanctuary at Brauron.</li>
<li>Cult functions often restricted to a few girls or just noble girls, but were symbolic of their ritual importance to the city.</li>
<li>Girls involved in choral song and dance on ritual occasions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Domestic role
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Girls married at a young age: the marriage was arranged by her parents and the groom and she would bring a dowry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>SLAVES</h3>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Religious role
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Slaves had a role in some festivals e.g.Anthesteria.</li>
<li>They could be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries.</li>
<li>There was a holiday especially for slaves - the Kronia - where state business was suspended and slaves dined with their masters.</li>
<li>Likely there were many ritual occasions where slaves participated informally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Legal position
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Were mostly treated as property under Athenian law.</li>
<li>Could be bought, sold, and beaten (only by master).</li>
<li>Legal action for offences against slaves had to be brought by masters.</li>
<li>If slaves required to give evidence in a law suit, this evidence would have to have been obtained under torture, otherwise the evidence was invalid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Political position
<ul class="tier2">
<li>Public slaves were the property of the polis, were a sort of 'elite'.</li>
<li>In theory, a male slave could become a citizen as if freed he became a metic (most slaves were foreigners) and could then be granted citizenship.</li>
<li>Although slaves had no political rights they made up about one third of the city-state's population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="tier0">
<li>Economic position

<li>Female slaves worked in craft shops around the agora.</li>
<li>Male slaves were involved in the building of the Erechtheon.</li>
<li>Prostitutes were mostly slaves working in brothels.</li>
<li>In unusual circumstance slaves could become wealthy: some worked in trade, manufacture and banking.</li>
<li>Slaves are sometimes described as 'living apart': they lived and worked independently, made periodic payments to their masters.</li>
<li>Most slaves in the public domain were skilled workers e.g. miners, artisans, craftsmen.</li>
<li>Many slaves worked in the silver mines of Laurion.</li>
<li>Many slaves were private slaves working in family houses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
