&intro=Theatres, where today you might go to see a show or pantomime, first appeared in ancient Greece. Theatres then were the setting for plays written by poets such as Aeschylus, Euripides and Aristophanes. There were different types of play: <font color="#660000"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/t/tragedy.html','glos')">tragedies</a></u></font>, comedies and also <font color="#660000"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/satyr.html','glos')">satyr</a></u></font> plays, although we don't know very much about this last type.<br><br>Theatre for the Ancient Greeks was not just entertainment; it was part of the worship of the god Dionysos during religious festivals.<br><br>Explore a model based on the theatre of <font color="#660000"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/dionysos.html','glos')">Dionysos</a></u></font> on the slope of the Acropolis at Athens.&theatron_title=Theatron
