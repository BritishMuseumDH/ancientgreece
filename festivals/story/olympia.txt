&d3_e2=<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="14">In the stadium, the crowds wait for the running races to begin. First is the long-distance race, called the dolichos.

&d4_e3=<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="14">Whilst the boxing continues, another event takes place that requires the strength and skills of boxing and wrestling - the pankration. The athletes can strike and kick each other and even use strangleholds to defeat their opponent. The only things not allowed are biting and <font color="#660000"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/g/gouging.html','glos')">gouging</a></u></font> with the fingers.

Like the <font color="#660000"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/j/javelin.html','glos')">javelin</a></u></font>, this reminds those watching that sporting effort is vital for war, as it ensures the soldiers are fit and strong.

Twenty-five identical shields are kept in the Temple of Zeus for the competitors to use, so ensuring that no one cheats with a lighter shield.<br><br>As the winner crosses the finishing line, the crowds stand and cheer, knowing that it will be four years before they watch this race again.</font>
