&trial1=My stepmother, Eirene, is guilty of poisoning my father. I am here to ask for his murderer to be punished. 
Eirene asked her friend to give poison to my father while he was dining in Piraeus. She told her friend that it was a harmless love potion.  My stepmother was quite happy for her friend to be accused of this murder and killed in punishment!
This is not the first time Eirene has tried to kill my father. Please help me find justice and punish this woman for her crime!
&trial2=My mother is completely innocent of this crime. She believed that the mixture she gave my father was a love-potion. She did not intend to kill him. She just wanted to make their love stronger. His death was an accident.
My half brother, Apelleas, will tell you that my mother had tried to murder father before. However, he has no evidence for this.  
Let my poor grieving mother go free!
&trial7=Do you think Eirene is guilty?
If yes, place the solid ballot in the 'Verdict' hydria. If you think she's innocent, place the ballot with the hole in the 'Verdict' hydria.
&trial8=Place the ballot you didn't use in the 'Discard' hydria.
&trial9=We do not know what the result of this trial was. Why do you think Eirene did not speak for herself?
&trialOpening=Hear the arguments in the trial of Eirene and decide whether you think she is guilty or innocent!
