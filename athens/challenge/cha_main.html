<p><b>The Red Rope</b></p>
<p>
During the late 5th century B.C. Athens employed Scythian slaves to round up citizens to attend the public assembly. They carried between them a rope dipped in red paint. If a person tried to resist going to the assembly they were sure to get caught in the rope and have red paint on their clothes. Anyone who had red paint on their clothes at the assembly would not get paid for their attendance.
