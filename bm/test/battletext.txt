Their forces were made up of heavily-armed foot soldiers, called hoplites. About half of these hoplites were Spartans and half were from the Perioikoi.

The shield was up to one metre across and was held on the left forearm. This meant that the shield only covered one half of the body. This problem was overcome by the rigid formation of hoplite fighting.
