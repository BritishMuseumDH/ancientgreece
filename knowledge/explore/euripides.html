Euripides was a playwright from Athens. He wrote tragedies. He wrote over 90 plays including Trojan Woman, Medea and Suppliant Woman. 

<p>
He had a very bleak view of humankind and his plays were often dark and grim.  Aristotle called him the most tragic of all the ancient playwrights.
</p>
<p>
He created very strong female roles in his plays. In Medea, Euripides writes about a witch, Medea, who has been abandoned by her husband Jason. She is driven almost mad by jealousy and anger. She finally takes revenge on her husband by killing their children.
