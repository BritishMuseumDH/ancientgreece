<h3>Aristophanes<br>c.448 - 385 BC</h3>
<div align="center"><img src="images/aristophanes.jpg" width="153" height="250" alt="Aristophanes" border="0"></div>
<p>Aristophanes was an Athenian playwright. He wrote comedies. His plays were often set in the present day and mocked the most important people in the city.</p>

<p>His plays poked fun at the Athenian way of life. For example, in the Wasps a son has to build a courtroom in his house because his father has become addicted to attending trials.  Aristophanes invites his audience to laugh at their own love of going to court and attending trials.</p>

<p>Only eleven of his plays survive.  These include Clouds, Lysistrata and Women at the Thesmophoria.
