<p>Sokrates was a Greek philosopher who had a great influence on Athenian society and later philosophers.</p>

<p>He had an unusual way of sharing his views. He would question the people around him very carefully to show the holes or contradictions in their thinking.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to death in 399BC for 'corrupting the young'. He died by drinking hemlock, which is a type of poison.</p>
