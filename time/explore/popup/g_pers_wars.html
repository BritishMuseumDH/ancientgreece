<h3>The Persian Wars: 499 - 449 BC</h3>

<p>499 BC marked the beginning of nearly half a century of fighting between the Greek states and Persia. In 499 the East Greek cities that were under Persian rule revolted against Persia and were defeated. Because they had been helped by mainland Greeks from Athens and Eretria, in 490 BC the Persian King Darius led an attack on mainland Greece. The Persians landed at Marathon, around 40 kilometres from Athens. Although the Persians greatly outnumbered the Athenians, they were outwitted by the Greeks and suffered great losses. </p>

<p>In 480 BC, the new Persian king, Xerxes, launched a new wave of attacks on Greece. He sent a large army by land through the north of Greece. He also sent a fleet of ships. The Persians fought to victory in battles at Thermopylai and Salamis, but were totally defeated at Plataia. Despite further minor battles, Persia was no longer a real threat. In 449 BC, peace between Athens and Persia was declared.</p>
