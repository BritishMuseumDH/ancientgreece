<h3>The Peloponnesian War</h3>

<p>The Peloponnesian War lasted over 27 years. It was a war between Athens and Sparta and their allies. Sparta and Athens had already fought each other between 460 and 446 BC, a conflict known as the First Peloponnesain War. After these earlier hostilities, a truce was agreed in 445 called the Thirty Years' Treaty, but fighting broke out again in 433 when Athens violated the terms of the treaty.</p>  

<p></p>By 431 BC, the Athenian alliance included most of the island and coastal states around the northern and eastern shores, and so had the stronger navy and finances. Sparta lead an alliance of independent states and had the stronger army. </p>

<p></p>After ten years of fighting between 431 and 421 BC, a fifty-year peace was agreed which only lasted for a few years. War broke out again fully in 413 BC after the failure of an Athenian invasion of Sicily. This second leg of the Peloponnesian War finally ended with the defeat of Athens in 404 BC.</p>
