<h3>Ionian revolt against Persian rule</h3>

<p>There were many Greek cities along the western coast of modern day Turkey under the rule of the Persian empire. They were obedient subjects of King Darius.</p>

<p>The Ionian Greeks started to become unhappy with Persian rule when they had to give more money and men to the empire. In 499 BC they rebelled and threw out their local rulers. </p>

<p>Athens and Eretria sent help to support the uprising. The Persians were able to put down the rebellion. However, the Persian King never forgave Athens for helping the rebels.</p>
