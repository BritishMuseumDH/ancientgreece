<h3>Battle of Marathon</h3>

<p>In 490 BC the Persian King Darius led an attack on mainland Greece.  The Persians landed at Marathon, around 40 kilometres from Athens.</p>

<p>The Persians outnumbered the Athenians greatly. However, the Athenian army were able to outwit the Persians on the battlefield. Persia lost many men during the battle and was forced to retreat.</p>

<p>The modern marathon race gets its name from an event that occurred after the battle. A messenger was sent to Athens to announce their victory.  The messenger ran the 40 kilometres to Athens in three hours.  He was able to tell everyone the good news about the victory. Unfortunately the run proved to be too much for the messenger and he dropped dead from exhaustion.</p>
