<h3>Battle of Salamis</h3>

<p>Almost all Athenians fled from their city when they heard about the defeat at Thermopylai. Athens was destroyed by the approaching Persian army.</P> 

<p>The Persian navy sailed to Salamis where the Greek fleet waited. However, the Persian ships were unable to move as quickly as the Greek ships. The Greek navy was able to trap the Persians and defeat them.</p>
