<h3>Delian league</h3>

<p>A number of Greek cities joined together to make an alliance called the Delian League. The league was headed by Athens. All the cities in the league had to provide ships and men, or else money.</P>

<P>In time, as Athens grew more powerful, the league turned into an Athenian empire. The cities that belonged to it now had to send money to Athens as a tribute. Athens would punish the cities severely if they missed a payment.</p>
