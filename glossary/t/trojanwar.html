<!--ENTER GLOSSARY TEXT BELOW-->
This legendary war occurred sometime in the 12th century BC. Many stories became associated with the war. Traditionally it is said that the war started when the Trojan prince, Paris, abducted Helen, the wife of the King of Sparta, Menelaus. A number of Greek kings and princes joined with Menelaus to recapture Helen from Troy. The war lasted for ten years. Another famous myth about the war is that the Greeks finally won when they tricked the Trojans into accepting a gift of a wooden horse. The Trojans took the horse into their city. Little did the Trojans know that the Greek army were hidden inside the horse!
